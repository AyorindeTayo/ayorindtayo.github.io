---

* Downloading and Exploration of the Flower datasets
* Creating a dataset
* Validation split. 80% Of the images are separated for training and 20% for validation
* Visualize the data
* configuring the datasets for performance
* Standardization of the data
* Creating the model
* Train the model
* Data augumation to improves the accuaracy by simply geenerating additional training data from the existing examples by augumenting them using random transformations. Aslo, it exposes the   model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.
